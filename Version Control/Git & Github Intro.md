ðŸ“˜ Day 1 â€“ Version Control
ðŸ”¹ What is Version Control?
Version Control is a system that records changes to files over time so you can recall specific versions later.
It helps developers manage code, track history, and collaborate effectively.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Version Control Systems
Local VCS
Keeps changes in a local database on your computer.
Example: RCS (Revision Control System).

Centralized VCS (CVCS)
Single central server stores all versions.
Developers need internet access to interact.
Example: Subversion (SVN), CVS.

Distributed VCS (DVCS) âœ…
Every developer has a full copy of the repo (including history).
Work offline, push/pull changes when online.
Example: Git, Mercurial.

ðŸ”¹ Why Use Version Control?

Track history of code changes
Collaboration with multiple developers
Rollback to previous versions
Branching & experimenting safely
Backup and recovery of code

ðŸ”¹ Git Key Terminologies

Repository (Repo): Project storage containing all files & history.
Clone: Copy of a remote repository on your local system.
Commit: Snapshot of changes with a descriptive message.
Branch: Separate line of development (default = main).
Merge: Combine changes from one branch into another.
Checkout: Switch between commits or branches.
Staging Area (Index): Prepares changes before committing.
HEAD: Pointer to the current commit/branch.
Pull: Fetch + merge changes from a remote repo.
Push: Send local commits to a remote repo.
Fetch: Download changes from remote without merging.
Conflict: When two branches change the same code differently.
Tag: Label attached to a specific commit (e.g., v1.0 release).

ðŸ”¹ GitHub Key Terminologies

Remote Repository: Repo hosted on GitHub.
Fork: Your personal copy of someone elseâ€™s repo.
Pull Request (PR): Proposal to merge your changes into another branch/repo.
Issues: Used for bug reports, tasks, and feature tracking.
Actions (CI/CD): Automations like tests, builds, and deployments.
Stars: Way to bookmark/appreciate a repo.
Watch: Get repo update notifications.
Gist: Share small code snippets.
Collaborators: People invited to contribute.
GitHub Pages: Free hosting for static websites from a repo.

âœ… Key Takeaway:
Git = Tool for version control
GitHub = Cloud platform to host, collaborate, and manage Git repositories
