# ðŸ“¦ Introduction to Docker

## ðŸ”¹ What is Docker?
- Docker is a **platform for developing, shipping, and running applications**.
- Uses **containerization** to package applications with all dependencies.
- Solves the "works on my machine" problem.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Docker?
- Lightweight alternative to virtual machines.
- Provides **isolation** between applications.
- Ensures **consistency** across environments (dev, test, prod).
- Faster deployment and scaling.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts

### 1. Container
- Lightweight, portable unit that runs an application.
- Shares the host OS kernel but isolated from other containers.

### 2. Image
- Blueprint for containers.
- Contains code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
- Immutable once built.

### 3. Dockerfile
- Script to build images automatically.
- Contains instructions like:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu:20.04
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3
  COPY . /app
  CMD ["python3", "app.py"]



4. Docker Engine

Core part of Docker: client + server (daemon).

5. Registry

Repository for images (e.g., Docker Hub).

ðŸ”¹ Docker Architecture

Client: Runs commands (docker run, docker build).

Daemon (dockerd): Manages containers and images.

Registry: Stores Docker images.

Objects: Images, Containers, Volumes, Networks.



#Basic Commands 

# Pull an image
docker pull ubuntu

# Run a container
docker run -it ubuntu bash

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers
docker ps -a

# Build an image
docker build -t myapp .

# Stop a container
docker stop <container_id>

# Remove a container
docker rm <container_id>

# Remove an image
docker rmi <image_id>


ðŸ”¹ Volumes & Persistence

Containers are ephemeral (data lost when stopped).

Volumes store data outside the container lifecycle.

docker run -v /host/path:/container/path myapp
